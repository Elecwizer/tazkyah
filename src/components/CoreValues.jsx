            At Tazkyah, our core values guide everything we do. They shape our teaching approach, 
            our interactions with students, and our vision for nurturing the next generation.

            <h3>Growth Mindset</h3>
            <p>We believe in the potential of every child to grow and develop. We foster a growth mindset 
            that encourages children to embrace challenges, persist through obstacles, and see effort as 
            a path to mastery.</p>

            <h3>Respect & Empathy</h3>
            <p>We teach children to respect themselves, others, and their environment. Through empathy 
            and understanding, children learn to appreciate diverse perspectives and build meaningful 
            relationships.</p>

            <h3>Critical Thinking</h3>
            <p>We encourage children to think critically, ask questions, and explore ideas. By developing 
            strong analytical skills, children become independent thinkers capable of making sound decisions.</p>

            <h3>Global Citizenship</h3>
            <p>We prepare children to become responsible global citizens who understand their place in the world 
            and their responsibility to contribute positively to society.</p>

            <h3>Integrity & Ethics</h3>
            <p>We emphasize the importance of integrity, honesty, and ethical behavior. Children learn to 
            make principled choices and take responsibility for their actions.</p>

            <p>We are committed to continuously improving our teaching methods and curriculum to provide the 
            best possible learning experience for our students.</p>
