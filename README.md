# Tazkhya.org

**Tazkhya.org** is a bilingual (Arabic & English) online platform dedicated to the Tazkyah initiative. Our mission is to nurture a generation of responsible and principled youth by offering high-quality, interactive courses that instill essential moral values in children.

## Motivation

In today's fast-paced and ever-changing world, parents face increased challenges balancing work, technology, and raising children with strong moral values. Tazkyah aims to address this need by providing engaging courses taught by professional mentors. Our platform makes it easy for children to learn and grow, while also informing the public about the initiative's mission.

## Summary

Tazkhya.org serves as a course hosting and information platform where:
- **Users** can sign up, enroll in courses, attend lectures, and access course materials.
- **Instructors** can add courses, conduct online classes, and share resources.
- **Admins** can update initiative details targeted at school-age children.

Due to limitations with the previous website—which was built using online blog tools without a dedicated backend—the owners reached out to us, a team of university students from KFUPM, to help reshape the platform into a fully functional and reliable online learning application.
